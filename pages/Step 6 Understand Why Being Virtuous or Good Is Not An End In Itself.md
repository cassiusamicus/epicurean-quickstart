- Many people are tempted to think that the goal of life is to be praised as being "Virtuous" or "Good," but Epicurus taught that those high-sounding words mean nothing in themselves.
- Epicurus shows us that there is no such thing as absolute virtue or absolute good, and that therefore being virtuous or good is not an end it itself, but only the means to some other end. Epicurus taught that the end established by Nature is Pleasure.
- Epicurus taught that the test of whether any conduct is "virtuous" or "good" is whether it in practice leads to a pleasurable life. In every decision ask: "What will happen if I choose this course of action and what will happen if I do not?"
- Epicurus shows that once we see that the true test of whether any action is prudent, honorable, and just is whether it leads to a life of pleasure, we can then understand that a life of pleasure is inseparable from a life of prudence, honor, and justice.
- note: Given that Nature gives living things only pleasure as a guide for what to pursue, consistency impels us to the conclusion that Nature guides us to organize our affairs to pursue pleasure, which is the means of obtaining a life of happiness. Diogenes of Oinoanda stated it this way: “The issue is not "what is the means of happiness?" but "what is happiness and what is the ultimate goal of our nature?," I say both now and always, shouting out loudly to all Greeks and non-Greeks, that pleasure is the end of the best mode of life, while the virtues, which are inopportunely messed about by these people (being transferred from the place of the means to that of the end), are in no way an end, but the means to the end."
- Epicurean spokesman Torquatus phrased the point this way: “It is plain that all right and praiseworthy action has the life of pleasure for its aim. Now inasmuch as the climax or goal or limit of things good (which the Greeks term telos) is that object which is not a means to the attainment of any thing else, while all other things are a means to its attainment, we must allow that the climax of things good is to live agreeably.” … “If then even the glory of the Virtues, on which all the other philosophers love to expatiate so eloquently, has in the last resort no meaning unless it be based on pleasure, whereas pleasure is the only thing that is intrinsically attractive and alluring, it cannot be doubted that pleasure is the one supreme and final Good and that a life of happiness is nothing else than a life of pleasure.”
- U423 **Plutarch, *That Epicurus actually makes a pleasant life impossible*, 7, p. 1091A:** Not only is the basis that they assume for the pleasurable life untrustworthy and insecure, it is quite trivial and paltry as well, inasmuch as their “thing delighted” – their good – is an escape from ills, and they say that they can conceive of no other, and indeed that our nature has no place at all in which to put its good except the place left when its evil is expelled. … Epicurus too makes a similar statement to the effect that the good is a thing that arises out of your very escape from evil and from your memory and reflection and gratitude that this has happened to you. His words are these: “That which produces a jubilation unsurpassed is the nature of good, if you apply your mind rightly and then stand firm and do not stroll about {a jibe at the Peripatetics}, prating meaninglessly about the good.”
