- Epicurus first became interested in philosophy because he did not accept his teachers' explanation that the universe arose from Chaos. Epicurus went on to revise Democritus' theory of atoms and void, rejecting atomic reductionism and affirming the reality of things at both the human and atomic levels.
- Epicurus taught that knowledge is possible through an approach he called "Canonics."  This system is grounded in the three faculties given us by Nature - the five senses, the feelings of pleasure and pain, and the pattern-recognizing faculty of anticipations -  as the basis on which to form our opinions about what is true.
- Epicurus taught that "Physics" rests on the laws of nature, which itself derives from the unchanging and eternal Atoms and Void.  Everything which comes from the atoms moves and changes over time, but not so fast that we cannot grasp that nothing comes from nothing or goes to nothing.  From this starting point we deduce that the universe is infinite in size and eternal in time, that the Earth is not unique, and that life is not supernatural but exists throughout the universe.
