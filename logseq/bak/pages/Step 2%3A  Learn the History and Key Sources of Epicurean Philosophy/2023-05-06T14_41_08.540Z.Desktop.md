- **Epicurus** was born in Samos, Greece in 341 BC, and died in Athens in 270 BC.
- ­Epicurus started his school decades after the death of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, and about the same time as the founding of the Stoic school, all more than 200 years before Christianity.
- ­**Diogenes Laertius** wrote a biography of Epicurus which includes the full text of three of his key letters, as well as a list of Epicurus' Principal Doctrines.
- ­**Lucretius** wrote "On The Nature of Things," a poetic summary of the heart of Epicurean philosophy.
- ­**Diogenes of Oinoanda** erected a stone wall on which was inscribed many key elements of the philosophy of Epicurus.
- ­Other texts survive, but they are frequently either written by opponents of Epicurus, or so fragmentary that their meaning is unclear. Read such works skeptically and compare them closely to the most well preserved texts of Diogenes Laertius, Lucretius, and Diogenes of Oinoanda.
